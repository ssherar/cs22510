\section*{Abstract}

In this report, I will be analysing my experience and efforts when writing the first part of this assignment in three different languages: \texttt{C}, \texttt{C++} and \texttt{Java}. I will try and discuss through why I choose the languages to tackle the certain tasks at hand, and then make recommendations oh how I would go about the tasks in a different manor if I had the chance to.

For the assignment, I decided to use \texttt{C} for the Event Manager application; \texttt{C} for the Event Creation application and \texttt{Java} for the Checkpoint Manager. I went down these lines because of one main reason: I have already written a working event manager application in C for the CS223 assignment in Semester One, and I didn't want to waste precious time ``reinventing the wheel'' by rewriting the application for the more suited language such as \texttt{Java} or \texttt{C++}.

As those decisions have already been made, it soon fell in line that I would use \texttt{Java} for the Checkpoint Manager, as I've already had experience writing a GUI based application in it before; while using \texttt{C++} for the Event Creation as I have little experience programming in it, and it seemed the easier application to write.
